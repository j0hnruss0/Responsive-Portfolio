        <p>Greetings! I am John Russo. I have a Bachelor's Degree from City College
            and experience in multiple fields ranging from real estate to fine art.
            I am learning how to code in hopes of starting a new career in the field 
            of Computer Programming!
        </p>

        <p>I already have some experience in coding. I did teach myself to make my
            first website, which was an online portfolio of my artwork. It was only
            made up of HTML and CSS so it's my hope I can learn new programming
            languages to further strengthen my online skills. I always willing and
            able to improve!
        </p>
